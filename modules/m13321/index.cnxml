				Here's where you put celebrations and traditions. This is where an exchange

				carrier; it could be a river; it could be a sacred text; it could be an

				needed? What's next? (30 minutes) </para>

				community might be drawn as a spider creating a web in which they "catch" the
				history and stories of the community. The thunder and lightening might be
				obstacles that threaten the tree's survival and growth. What are the tree's
				sources of nutrition and support? Represent this living ecology,

				"Observation Journal" of things you notice along the way. (An Observation
				Journal can consist of folding a sheet of paper in half and writing your notes
				there and later typing them into the assignment template below.) Your
				completed Observation Journal must have at least 7 entries (include the
				dates). Each entry can be in the form of a list of 5 observations that start
				with the words, "Today, I noticedâ€¦" or it can be plain observations written
				in paragraph form. </para>

				"Today I noticed that Mr. Olatunji came into the room at 7:35 p.m., sat in the
				back, and listened to our literacy group. Afterwards, he asked if he could
				join us the next time we meet," or "Today I noticed the fourth group in our
				conflict mediation meeting sat in silence." </para>

			<para id="para_N77580"> As your Service Project progresses, keep another

				your Field Advisor or mentor; ideas sparked by articles you've read on-line
				or in the paper (give the title and source and say what idea it sparked for
				you.); ideas you thought of when engaging in your muse-related ritual, or
				while taking a walk, fishing, day dreaming, or dreaming at night. </para>
