			<title>Reggio Emilia - Example of Excellence</title>
			
			<para id="para_N67727">
				
			</para>
			
			<para id="para_N67772"> Researchers at Wayne State University tell us that
				"The Reggio approach is not a method or a curriculum, but is a set of
				principles for integrating children's development and social-cultural
				environment with the best theory and practice concerning children's
				education. This approach has created great enthusiasm among parents,
				teachers and educators throughout the early childhood community."
				</para>
			<para id="para_N67775"> Teachers Without Borders has tested many of Reggio
				Emilia's ideas and find them to be workable in multiple settings, across
				cultures and economic lines. </para>
			<para id="para_N67778">
				<emphasis>(Adapted from www.education-world.com) </emphasis>
			</para>
			<para id="para_N67784"> If you were to walk into a Reggio school, you would see an
				extraordinary engagement of children and a high degree of responsiveness
				and creativity. At first, one might be concerned that children are not
				drilled, early on, to learn their numbers. Rather, this skill is developed,
				gradually, through a variety of activities. The children also learn about
				numbers by solving number-related problems. For example, teachers might
				ask children to determine whether their school or another building nearby
				was taller. They had two to three days to contemplate the question. Teachers
				might not tell them how to arrive at the answer but, rather, would allow them
				to find the answer on their own. </para>
			<para id="para_N67787"> Teacher training is taken quite seriously. </para>
			<para id="para_N67790"> The U.S. Secretary of Education, Richard Riley
				observed: "The teachers respect the ideas and values that the children
				bring to the school, and the teachers are smart enough to build on the
				creativity of the children." </para>
			<para id="para_N67793"> "In the last ten years, an extraordinary amount of
				scientific research has been developed that tells us in very clear terms
				that all of our children, even in the earliest months of their lives, have an
				amazing ability to learn." Riley continued: "We now know that it is
				absolutely imperative that we put a new, powerful, and sustained focus on
				the early years - birth to five - before children even enter first grade.
				</para>
			<para id="para_N67796"> "Put simply, and this should be our collective motto -
				the stronger the start, the better the finish," Riley added. "We now know
				that every conversation we have with an infant can literally spark [his or
				her] brain to grow some more. Our children are eager to learn, they are
				creative in how they learn, and they have an extraordinary capacity to learn
				if we know how to encourage them the right way. " </para>

			<para id="para_N67823">
				
			</para>
			
			<para id="para_N67868"> Adults are often amazed by young children's
				unexpected perceptions of the world and the unique ways in which they
				express their imagination. We also know, however, that children usually
				need adult support to find the means and the confidence to bring forth their
				ideas day after day. When considering both teacher-initiated and
				child-initiated strategies for enhancing young children's
				self-expression and creativity, the preschools of Reggio Emilia, Italy,
				can be a universal resource. </para>
			<para id="para_N67871">
				<term>How Young Children Learn</term>
			</para>
			<para id="para_N67877"> In Reggio Emilia, Italy, home of some of the best
				preschools in the world, children grow up surrounded by centuries-old
				masterpieces of architecture, painting, and sculpture. Citizens are
				especially proud of their artistic heritage, and art becomes a natural
				vehicle in educational approaches for helping children explore and solve
				problems. </para>
			<para id="para_N67880"> The documentation of young children's work provided
				by Reggio Emilia educators highlights young children's amazing
				capabilities and indicates that it is through the unity of thinking and
				feeling that young children can explore their world, represent their
				ideas, and communicate with others at their highest level. When educators
				fully understand how exploration, representation, and communication
				feed one other, they can best help children achieve this potential. </para>
			<para id="para_N67883"> Several aspects of young children's learning are
				important to consider when thinking about art and creative activities
				(Edwards &amp; Hiler, 1993). First, young children are developmentally
				capable of classroom experiences which call for (and practice)
				higher-level thinking skills, including analysis (breaking down
				material into component parts to understand the structure, seeing
				similarities and differences); synthesis (putting parts together to form
				a new whole, rearranging, reorganizing); and evaluation (judging the
				value of material based on definite criteria). </para>

			<para id="para_N67955">
				
			</para>
			<para id="para_N67958"> Second, young children want and need to express ideas
				and messages through many different expressive avenues and symbolic
				media. Young children form mental images, represent their ideas, and
				communicate with the world in a combination of ways. They need increasing
				competence and integration across formats including words, gestures,
				drawings, paintings, sculpture, construction, music, dramatic play,
				movement, and dance. Through sharing and gaining others' perspectives,
				and then revisiting and revising their work, children move to new levels of
				awareness. Teachers act as guides, careful not to impose adult ideas and
				beliefs upon the children. </para>
			<para id="para_N67961"> Third, young children learn through meaningful
				activities in which different subject areas are integrated. Open-ended
				discussions and long-term activities bring together whole-language
				activities, science, social studies, dramatic play, and artistic
				creation. Activities that are meaningful and relevant to the child's life
				experiences provide opportunities to teach across the curriculum and
				assist children in seeing the interrelationships of things they are
				learning. </para>
			<para id="para_N67964"> Teachers have many opportunities to integrate
				curriculum. For example, the arrival of a new sibling is a common
				occurrence. Teachers might ask parents of children in their class to
				contribute photographs of the children as infants, toddlers, and
				preschoolers, so that the children who are interested can make scrapbooks.
				If such photos are unavailable, the children can draw or cut pictures from
				magazines, or dictate stories about remembered foods, toys, or bedroom
				furnishings. Such activities, designed to help a child deal with a new baby,
				also help children to use spoken and written language and to select and
				organize materials. </para>
			<para id="para_N67967"> Fourth, young children benefit from in-depth
				exploration and long-term, open-ended projects which are started either
				from a chance event, a problem posed by one or more children, or an experience
				planned and led in a flexible way by teachers (Edwards &amp; Springate,
				1993; Clark, 1994). The adults act as resource persons, problem-posers,
				guides, and partners to the children in the process of discovery and
				investigation. They take their cues from children through careful
				listening and observation, and know when to encourage risk-taking and when
				to refrain from interfering. </para>

			<title>The Reggio Classroom</title>
			
			<para id="para_N67994">
				
			</para>
			
			<para id="para_N68039"> A Reggio classroom is noticeably different from a
				traditional one. Large windows fill the rooms with light, and there is
				plenty of open space allowing room for children to move around. The room is
				decorated with children's art. All of the decorations in the room are
				created by the children. Natural materials such as pine cones, seashells,
				and wood are freely available and encourage exploration, expression and
				learning. </para>
			<para id="para_N68042"> The goal of the Reggio approach is to educate the whole
				child - spirit and heart as well as mind. It's a holistic approach to
				education, one in which art - in all forms - plays a large part. Reggio
				teachers allow children to express themselves in ways other than writing or
				speaking. </para>
			<para id="para_N68045"> According to the Reggio approach, each child is born
				with 100 "languages" to help them represent their ideas, but society,
				parents, and teachers take away 99 and leave the spoken language as the only
				way of expression. The goal of the school is to give back the other 99 -
				allowing for an enormous range of expression. </para>
			<para id="para_N68048"> Children may start the day with an assembly and
				discussion. Back in their classrooms, they're free to move around the room,
				work with other children and become involved in projects of their own
				choosing. </para>
			<para id="para_N68051"> Artistic opportunity abounds. Children often learn
				to write through clay - they form their letters and numbers with it. The
				children built the letters using wire as a base so that the letters stand up.
				</para>
			<para id="para_N68054"> Reggio also emphasizes group projects and team
				approaches to solving problems. In one Reggio school in Italy, for example,
				the children thought that their playground was boring. They brainstormed
				ideas to make it more interesting - with the teacher as guide and observer -
				and decided to create an amusement park for birds. The idea turned into a
				year-long project in which the children built a bird-bath complete with
				fountain, learning about hydraulics in the process. </para>

			<para id="para_N68132">
				<term>Time - </term>Creativity does not follow the clock. Children need
				extended, unhurried time to explore and do their best work. They should not
				be artificially rotated, that is, asked to move to a different learning
				center or activity when they are still productively engaged and motivated
				by a piece of creative work. </para>
			<para id="para_N68138">
				<term>Space</term> - Children need a place to leave unfinished work to
				continue the next day, and a space that inspires them to do their best work. A
				barren, drab environment is not conducive to creative work. Rather,
				children's work is fostered by a space that has natural light, harmonious
				colors, comfortable and child-sized areas, examples of their own and
				others' work (not only their classmates, but as appropriate, also their
				teachers' and selected adult artists), and inviting materials. </para>
			<para id="para_N68144">
				<term>Materials</term> - Without spending great amounts of money,
				teachers can organize wonderful collections of resource materials that
				might be bought, found, or recycled. These materials can include paper
				goods of all kinds; writing and drawing tools; materials for constructions
				and collages, such as buttons, stones, shells, beads, and seeds; and
				sculpting materials, such as play dough, goop, clay, and shaving cream.
				These materials are used most productively and imaginatively by children
				when they themselves have helped select, organize, sort, and arrange them.
				</para>
			<para id="para_N68150">
				<term>Climate -</term> The classroom atmosphere should reflect the
				adults' encouragement and acceptance of mistakes, risk-taking,
				innovation, and uniqueness, along with a certain amount of mess, noise, and
				freedom. This is not a matter of chaos, or of tight control, but instead
				something in between. In order to create such a climate, teachers must give
				themselves permission to try artistic activity themselves, even when they
				have not been so fortunate as to have had formal art training or to feel they
				are naturally "good at art." Through workshops, adult education classes,
				or teamwork with an art teacher or parent, classroom teachers can gain the
				confidence for, and experience the pleasure of, venturing some distance
				down the road of self-expression in a medium in which they did not know they
				could be successful. Their skill will then translate into the work with the
				children. </para>
			<para id="para_N68156">
				<term>Occasions</term> - Children's best and most exciting work involves
				an intense or arousing encounter between themselves and their inner or
				outer world. Teachers provide the occasions for these adventures.
				Children find it hard to be creative without any concrete inspiration.
				Instead, they prefer to draw on the direct evidence of their senses or
				memories. These memories can become more vivid and accessible through the
				teacher's provocations and preparations. For example, teachers can
				encourage children to represent their knowledge and ideas before and after
				they have watched an absorbing show, taken a field trip, or observed and
				discussed an interesting plant or animal brought into class. Teachers can
				put up a mirror or photos of the children in the art area, so children can study
				their faces as they draw their self- portrait. Teachers can offer children
				the opportunity to check what they have drawn against an original model and
				then let them revise and improve upon their first representation. </para>

				up the steep grassy slope toward the open ridge at the top. There were seven
				adult males in the group, including Goliath and David Greybeard, several
				females, and a few youngsters. As they reached the ridge the chimpanzees
				paused. At that moment the storm broke. The rain was torrential, and the
				sudden clap of thunder, right overhead, made me jump. As if this were a
				signal, one of the big males stood upright and as he swayed and swaggered
				rhythmically from foot to foot, I could just hear the rising crescendo of his
				pant-hoots above the beating of the rain. Then he charged off, flat-out down
				the slope toward the trees he had just left. He ran some thirty yards, and
				then, swinging round the trunk of a small tree to break his headlong rush,
				leaped into the low branches and sat motionless. </para>

				hurling it ahead of him. The other, as he reached the end of his run, stood
				upright and rhythmically swayed the branches of a tree back and forth before
				seizing a huge branch and dragging it farther down the slope. A fourth male,
				as he too charged, leaped into a tree and, almost without breaking his speed,
				tore off a large branch, leaped with it to the ground, and continued down the
				slope. As the last two males called and charged down, the one who had started
				the whole performance climbed from his tree and began plodding up the slope
				again. The others, who had also climbed into trees near the bottom of the
				slope, followed suit. When they reached the ridge, they started charging
				down all over again, one after the other, with equal vigor. </para>
			<para id="para_N70467"> The females and youngsters had climbed into trees near
				the top of the rise as soon as the displays had begun, and there they remained
				watching throughout the whole performance. As the males charged down and
				plodded back up, so the rain fell harder, jagged forks or brilliant flares of
				lightening lit the leaden sky, and the crashing of the thunder seemed to

			<para id="para_N71173"> The arts play a central role in many cultures around the
				world. In Bali, for example, the community participates in art-making from
				birth to old age. Each member of the community knows him/herself to be "an
				artist." In other cultures the artist is put up on a stage to sing alone or the
				term "artist" is reserved for people demonstrating a particular level of
				skill or advanced form of study. </para>
			<para id="para_N71176"> From the example of the Reggio Emilia preschools,
				however, it becomes clear that children are, indeed, natural artists, and
				that educating through the arts comes easily. In this section, we move from
				this premise of an natural fit between education and the arts to examine
				application in the classroom and our communities. </para>
			<para id="para_N71179"> Learning through the arts supports the work of
				multiple intelligences and helps create a venue for different ways of
				knowing about ourselves and others. Art stimulates the imagination,
				nurtures students' willingness to be innovative, to problem solve, to
				learn about each other, and other cultures. It reinforces observational
				and interpretive skills, and adds a qualitative dimension to life. Through
				art children learn about working in groups, working alone, and expressing
				personal insights and emotions. Art creates a lively dialogue within
				ourselves, our schools, and our community. </para>

			<para id="para_N71251"> Given what is known about young children's learning
				and about their amazing competence to express their visions of themselves
				and their world, how can the classroom be modified to best support
				children's emerging creativity? </para>
			<para id="para_N71254">
				<term>Time - </term>Creativity does not follow the clock. Children need
				extended, unhurried time to explore and do their best work. They should not
				be artificially rotated, that is, asked to move to a different learning
				center or activity when they are still productively engaged and motivated
				by a piece of creative work. </para>
			<para id="para_N71260">
				<term>Space</term> - Children need a place to leave unfinished work to
				continue the next day, and a space that inspires them to do their best work. A
				barren, drab environment is not conducive to creative work. Rather,
				children's work is fostered by a space that has natural light, harmonious
				colors, comfortable and child-sized areas, examples of their own and
				others' work (not only their classmates, but as appropriate, also their
				teachers' and selected adult artists), and inviting materials. </para>
			<para id="para_N71266">
				<term>Materials</term> - Without spending great amounts of money,
				teachers can organize wonderful collections of resource materials that
				might be bought, found, or recycled. These materials can include paper
				goods of all kinds; writing and drawing tools; materials for constructions
				and collages, such as buttons, stones, shells, beads, and seeds; and
				sculpting materials, such as play dough, goop, clay, and shaving cream.
				These materials are used most productively and imaginatively by children
				when they themselves have helped select, organize, sort, and arrange them.
				</para>
			<para id="para_N71272">
				<term>Climate -</term> The classroom atmosphere should reflect the
				adults' encouragement and acceptance of mistakes, risk-taking,
				innovation, and uniqueness, along with a certain amount of mess, noise, and
				freedom. This is not a matter of chaos, or of tight control, but instead
				something in between. In order to create such a climate, teachers must give
				themselves permission to try artistic activity themselves, even when they
				have not been so fortunate as to have had formal art training or to feel they
				are naturally "good at art." Through workshops, adult education classes,
				or teamwork with an art teacher or parent, classroom teachers can gain the
				confidence for, and experience the pleasure of, venturing some distance
				down the road of self-expression in a medium in which they did not know they
				could be successful. Their skill will then translate into the work with the
				children. </para>
			<para id="para_N71278">
				<term>Occasions</term> - Children's best and most exciting work involves
				an intense or arousing encounter between themselves and their inner or
				outer world. Teachers provide the occasions for these adventures.
				Children find it hard to be creative without any concrete inspiration.
				Instead, they prefer to draw on the direct evidence of their senses or
				memories. These memories can become more vivid and accessible through the
				teacher's provocations and preparations. For example, teachers can
				encourage children to represent their knowledge and ideas before and after
				they have watched an absorbing show, taken a field trip, or observed and
				discussed an interesting plant or animal brought into class. Teachers can
				put up a mirror or photos of the children in the art area, so children can study
				their faces as they draw their self- portrait. Teachers can offer children
				the opportunity to check what they have drawn against an original model and
				then let them revise and improve upon their first representation. </para>

			<para id="para_N74301">
				<term>MYTH #1 - </term>"Not all children can learn. The ones that cannot
				learn in the traditional classroom are simply not capable, and they need to
				be pulled out of the classroom and occupied." </para>
			<para id="para_N74307">
				<emphasis>Response to Myth #1:</emphasis> Traditional classrooms may
				not reach all children, but that does not mean they are stupid or
				unqualified. Special education students need more and better
				instruction, rather than separation and stigma. Skills to reach all
				children (the use of multiple intelligence, for example) have proven
				remarkably well in reaching students who would otherwise not learn.
				</para>
			<para id="para_N74313">
				<term>MYTH #2 - </term>"Special education instruction should be assigned
				to special education teachers. They know how to get through to children who
				are not learning." </para>
			<para id="para_N74319">
				<emphasis>Response to Myth #2: </emphasis> First, such a statement is
				often an excuse for not varying instruction. Second, not many schools
				around the world have special education teachers. Third, the roles of
				teachers are changing, and they are facing children with special needs more
				and more. To ignore these children is a tragedy. </para>
			<para id="para_N74325">
				<term>MYTH #3 - </term>"Children who exhibit behavior problems in school
				are incapable of making good choices. Once they learn how to make good
				choices, things will be better. Their parents may be at fault, or they just
				may be too 'slow' to understand the difference between right and wrong."
				</para>
			<para id="para_N74331">
				<emphasis>Response to Myth #3: </emphasis>Some children have not been
				taught coping skills effectively. Once the teacher expresses an interest
				in the child and forms a partnership with parents, such coping skills can,
				indeed, be taught. Children often live up to the expectations of parents and
				teachers. If s/he is told that s/he is "bad" or "stupid," s/he will act that
				way. The breaking down of pride, at an early age, is instrumental in
				destroying a child's belief in her/himself. It is the teacher's job to work
				with parents to ensure that children are validated for what they can do, for
				how they are improving, for how they have shown progress. Just as public
				humiliation is one of the worst experiences in a child's life; public
				acknowledgment is one of the best. Never underestimate the difference you
				can make in the lives and hopes of children. </para>

				<item>
					<term>Creating a classroom that allows all children to learn without
						restrictions:</term> Remove barriers for children who cannot
					see or hear well - move them up closer to the front; move the furniture in
					such a way so that you can see all of the students. Try to enlist parents or
					volunteers to be in your classroom to assist children who are
					struggling or to remove obstacles to their learning. </item>
				<item>
					<term>Responding to children with respect and care: </term> Practice
					how you are being perceived. Are you standing over children in a
					menacing way? Are your answers to questions varied? Patient? Are you
					taking extra time to ensure that you are understood? How are all
					children demonstrating to you that they know the material? By tests
					alone? Spend extra time with students you have identified as needing
					extra care. Develop a relationship. Work with them individually.
					Provide the kind of environment in your class where young people can
					tell you how they are doing, how they are feeling, and how they are
					approaching the tasks at hand. Do not battle with children over small
					things, for this erodes a child's self esteem. In many ways, accept
					approximations of the "correct" answer until you are confident you can
					expect more. But if a child is not delivering, no amount of chastizing
					will help. You may learn that the child was trying as hard as s/he could.
					</item>
				<item>
					<term>Modeling different kinds of learning: </term> Review the
					material on brain-based learning, problem-based learning, and
					multiple intelligences. Ensure that your lessons include these
					features. Develop questioning techniques that can approach learning
					from different angles. It is very important that you model the lesson in
					different ways. One of the best ways for young people to succeed is to do
					it themselves, but in a guided way. Such guided discovery - lasts,
					whereas, being forced to mimic an answer - never does. </item>
